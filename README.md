# Map Project - Interactive Map with Location-based Features

## Overview

This interactive map application provides users with location-based information including air quality data, bookmarking capabilities, and map sharing features. Built with Leaflet.js for mapping functionality and Node.js for the backend server, it allows users to explore locations, check current pollution levels, save favorite places, and export maps.

## Features

- **Interactive Map**: Navigate and explore using Leaflet's intuitive controls
- **Location Detection**: Automatically detects user's location on startup
- **Air Quality Data**: Displays real-time PM2.5 and PM10 levels for any clicked location
- **Bookmarks System**: Save, edit, and manage favorite locations
- **URL Sharing**: Generate shareable links with exact map position and zoom level
- **Map Export**: Export the current view as PNG image or PDF document
- **Responsive Design**: Works on both desktop and mobile devices
